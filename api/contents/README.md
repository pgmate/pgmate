# Local Contents

This folder represents a local mirror of:  
https://github.com/pgmate/contents/tree/main/contents

That is the source-of-truth for the contents that are distributed through PGMate.

At boot time PGMate tries hard to fetch the remote sources;
but if it fails it will use the local ones.
